# Teleop Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the setup of firmware for mello_gello.

There are two files in this directory:
- [MelloGello-UR5.m5f2](MelloGello-UR5.m5f2): The firmware file for the Mello controller.
- [UR_MelloGello.py](UR_MelloGello.py): The Python script to run the Mello controller.

[MelloGello-UR5.m5f2](MelloGello-UR5.m5f2) is a project file to be used with [UiFlow](https://uiflow2.m5stack.com/) to upload and run the firmware for the mello gello to the M5 stack device.

[UR_MelloGello.py](UR_MelloGello.py) is just the minimal python script which is already included in the MelloGello-UR5.m5f2 project file. It is provided here for reference and can be used to run the Mello controller without the UiFlow IDE, and can be used with [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).
